# How Apache Beam Makes Your Data Processing Go!

Learn how Apache Beam uses Go to execute your code against distributed datasets. As a language, Go brings unique challenges to designing a data processing framework. No inheritance, and no built-in serialization are just the start! This talk will cover how the Apache Beam Go SDK overcomes these challenges using reflection, interfaces, and generics to efficiently execute your data pipelines on arbitrary Beam Runners, like Apache Flink and Google Cloud Dataflow.
