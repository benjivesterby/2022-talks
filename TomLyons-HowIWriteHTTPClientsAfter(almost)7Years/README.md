# How I Write HTTP Clients After (almost) 7 Years

## Abstract

HTTP Servers have middleware.

HTTP Clients have… nothing?

Inspired by the well-known article and previous GopherCon talk “How I Write HTTP Services After 7/8 Years” by Mat Ryer, Tom aims to provide a rival paradigm for HTTP clients. This talk introduces and describes using client decorators for building better HTTP clients with easier testing and greater maintainability.
